## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Contract Proposal System

#### FR-1.1: Propose Contract
**Input**:
- Contract address (20 bytes)
- Chain ID (uint256)
- Bond amount (ETH value)

**Process**:
1. Validate contract not already proposed
2. Verify bond meets minimum requirement
3. Create Reality.eth question
4. Store proposal details
5. Lock bond amount

**Output**:
- Reality.eth question ID
- Proposal timestamp
- Event emission

**Constraints**:
- One active proposal per contract/chain pair
- Minimum bond requirement enforced
- Contract must not be paused

#### FR-1.2: Proposal Validation
**Automated Checks**:
- Non-zero contract address
- Valid chain ID (> 0)
- Sufficient bond amount
- No duplicate proposals

**Time Constraints**:
- Reality.eth timeout: 48 hours default
- No maximum proposal duration

### FR-2: Commit-Reveal Mechanism

#### FR-2.1: Commit Specification
**Input**:
- Contract address
- Chain ID
- Commitment hash (32 bytes)

**Process**:
1. Verify contract is proposed
2. Check no existing commitment from sender
3. Store commitment with timestamp
4. Begin reveal timeout period

**Output**:
- Commitment stored
- Timestamp recorded
- Event emission

**Constraints**:
- One commitment per address per contract
- Commitment must be non-zero
- Contract must be in proposed state

#### FR-2.2: Reveal Specification
**Input**:
- Contract address
- Chain ID
- Blob hash (32 bytes)
- Nonce (uint256)

**Process**:
1. Verify commitment exists
2. Calculate hash(blobHash, nonce)
3. Validate against stored commitment
4. Check within reveal timeout
5. Store specification data
6. Mark as revealed

**Output**:
- Specification ID
- Blob hash stored
- Event emission

**Constraints**:
- Reveal within 1 hour of commitment
- Exact hash match required
- Cannot reveal twice

### FR-3: Incentive Management

#### FR-3.1: Create Incentive
**Input**:
- Contract address
- Chain ID
- Deadline timestamp
- ETH amount (msg.value)

**Process**:
1. Validate deadline (future, within 30 days)
2. Calculate platform fee (5%)
3. Add to incentive pool
4. Store creator and deadline

**Output**:
- Updated pool balance
- Incentive record created
- Event emission

**Constraints**:
- Non-zero incentive amount
- Deadline maximum 30 days
- Multiple incentives can be pooled

#### FR-3.2: Claim Incentive
**Trigger**: Automatic on successful spec acceptance

**Process**:
1. Calculate share based on reveals
2. Deduct platform fee
3. Transfer to successful submitters
4. Update pool balance

**Distribution Formula**:
```
Individual Share = (Pool Amount - Platform Fee) / Number of Valid Submitters
Platform Fee = Pool Amount * 5%
```

#### FR-3.3: Clawback Incentive
**Input**:
- Contract address
- Chain ID

**Process**:
1. Verify caller is incentive creator
2. Check 90-day clawback period passed
3. Transfer remaining funds to creator
4. Clear incentive record

**Constraints**:
- Only original creator can clawback
- Must wait 90 days from creation
- Only unclaimed funds returned

### FR-4: Reality.eth Integration

#### FR-4.1: Question Creation
**Automatic Process**:
1. Generate question text
2. Set timeout (48 hours)
3. Set arbitrator address
4. Post to Reality.eth

**Question Format**:
```
"Is the ERC7730 specification [blobHash] for contract [address] on chain [chainId] correct?"
```

#### FR-4.2: Result Handling
**Input**: 
- Question ID
- Answer (bytes32)

**Process**:
1. Verify caller is Reality.eth
2. Check question exists
3. Process based on answer:
   - If accepted (0x01): Distribute rewards
   - If rejected (0x00): Refund bonds
4. Mark as settled

**Finalization Actions**:
- Update spec acceptance status
- Process incentive distributions

#### FR-5.2: Query Functions
**Available Queries**:
1. Get all specs for contract
2. Get paginated specs
3. Get spec count
4. Get spec blob hash
5. Get incentive pool status
6. Get user incentives

**Performance Requirements**:
